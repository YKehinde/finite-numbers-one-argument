#Finite-Numbers-One-argument

##Description
Create a function that takes a number as the argument. The return value of this function will be a list of numbers that have a length of the argument and whose characters are such that the next character is always greater than or equal to the previous character. For example, if the argument is 2,  11 and 12 will be valid numbers in the return list, while 20 and 10 will be invalid.
